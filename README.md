# chat-app-socketio
 A realtime messaging app, using JavaScript, React, ChakraUI, Express, MongoDb, and SocketIO

# Note: .env and database details are not included in the repo, I kept those private to limit access.
 
# to run locally:
In root app: npm i
In frontend folder: npm i 

Run concurrently:

Backend:
cd into root, npm start. Will take like 10 seconds to connect to MongoDB - localhost:3000

Frontend:
cd into frontend folder, npm start - localhost:3001

You can register, or use guest login. May need to refresh the page after you log in to see the chats page
